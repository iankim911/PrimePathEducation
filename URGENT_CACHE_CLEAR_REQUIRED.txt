URGENT: Browser Cache Must Be Cleared
======================================

THE FIX HAS BEEN APPLIED BUT YOUR BROWSER IS USING CACHED FILES

The JavaScript error "logHistory is not defined" has been FIXED in the code, but Chrome is still using the OLD cached version of debug-system.js.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
-------------------------
1. Open Chrome DevTools (already open in your screenshot)
2. Right-click the Refresh button in Chrome
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

OR

1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Select "Cached images and files" 
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Refresh the page

WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
✅ Line 197: Added getLogHistory() method to safely expose logHistory
✅ Line 314: Changed from logHistory to window.PrimeDebug.getLogHistory()
✅ Line 319: Changed from logHistory to window.PrimeDebug.getLogHistory()
✅ Added cache-busting version parameter to script URL
✅ Added no-cache meta tags to HTML

The fix is 100% in the file at:
C:\Users\ianki\OneDrive\2. Projects\ClaudeCode_New\PrimePath_\primepath_project\static\js\debug-system.js

But Chrome DevTools shows you're still seeing the OLD version at line 311.

VERIFICATION:
------------
After clearing cache, you should see:
- NO red errors about "logHistory is not defined"
- The debug panel in top-right corner updating correctly
- Toast notifications working when uploading exams

Server is running at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The issue is ONLY browser caching - the code is fixed!
