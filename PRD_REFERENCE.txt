📘 PrimePath Assessment Platform — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Executive Summary

Product Vision

PrimePath is a two-part educational assessment platform for K–12 English learners in Korea.

Module 1: Placement_Test
A web-based assessment tool for prospective students to take level tests online. Teachers upload exam PDFs (scanned), audio files, and answer keys. The system matches test difficulty to the student's input (grade and academic rank). Students may adjust difficulty mid-test via a button (+1 or -1 level). Results are auto-graded (except long answers) and mapped to the appropriate curriculum level.

Module 2: Progress_Tracker (Future Phase)
A logged-in system for enrolled students to take monthly assessments, track improvement, and receive personalized feedback. Teachers can assign exams by class, upload new tests, and view dashboards showing student progress. (Stretch: smart vocab tool, AI-powered diagnostics, mobile interface.)

Mission Statement

6. Architecture Overview

🔧 Simplified Architecture

Backend: Django (Python)

Frontend: Django templates (basic HTML forms rendered by backend)

Storage: Firebase or AWS S3 (for PDFs, audio)

Database: PostgreSQL

Hosting: Render.com (free tier with autoscaling)

Login: None for Module 1; Firebase/Kakao Auth for Module 2

📦 Media Notes

PDFs and audio stored externally (not embedded in DB)

File size limit for PDFs: 10MB (example threshold)

Auto-compression popup for larger files

7. Git & Deployment

Git Best Practices (Solo Dev)

✅ Commit often with clear messages ("feat: add QA preview")

✅ Push to GitHub main + use feature branches (feature/test-upload-form)

✅ Use .gitignore to exclude:

/media/

__pycache__

.env

.DS_Store

✅ Backup requirements:

requirements.txt or Pipfile

README.md

✅ Protect main branch (even if solo)

✅ Store secrets in .env file, never commit them

Deployment (Render)

Auto-deploy via GitHub connection

Add environment variables via Render dashboard

Use Gunicorn for Django server process

Setup /media/ path if local file storage is used (avoid long-term)

8. Future Roadmap (Module 2: Progress_Tracker)

Student login via Gmail or Kakao

Teachers assign test to class (Class A → Test X)

Teachers can edit/move students between classes; scores move with them

Reports generated per student (PDF or HTML)

🧠 Stretch: AI-generated insights (where the student is weak, what vocab to study)

📱 Stretch: Mobile vocab trainer with adaptive spaced repetition

9. Final Notes

Emphasize: "Employ best practices wherever possible for an LMS solution"

Key logic: keep cost low, avoid complexity unless needed, build scalable data model now

Claude should begin by scaffolding Placement_Test module and building student/teacher views as described
